# :chart_with_upwards_trend: Operation and Investigation Metric Analysis :bar_chart:
Operation analytics is the analysis performed for a company's whole end-to-end operations. This helps the business identify the areas where it needs to make improvements.

Being one of the most important parts of a company, this kind of analysis is further used to predict the overall growth or decline of a company‚Äôs fortune. It means better automation, better understanding between cross-functional teams, and more effective workflows.

Investigating metric spike is also an important part of operation analytics as being a Data Analyst one must be able to understand or make other teams understand questions like- Why is there a dip in daily engagement? Why have sales taken a dip? Etc. Questions like these must be answered daily and for that its very important to investigate metric spike.
